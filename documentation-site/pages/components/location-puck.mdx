# Location Puck

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...locationPuckYardConfig} />

A location puck is used to mark a user's location on the mark.

## When to use

Use a fixed marker when you are showcasing specific points or areas. Think of it like a pin pushed into a wallmap. The content won’t move around or adjust, it’s not travelling around, and it’s not attached to something dynamic.

Fixed markers are particularly helpful in draggable location setting situations, such as dragging around a marker to set your location.

For more information on the design principles behind the Base map markers, please visit the official [Base design website documentation](https://base.uber.com/map-usage-markers).
